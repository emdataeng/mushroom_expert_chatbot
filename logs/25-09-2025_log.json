        "expert_reply": "Mushrooms and plants share several fundamental characteristics. Both are multicellular organisms, which means they have cells that are organized into tissues and organs. Mushrooms, like plants, are autotrophs, meaning they produce their own food through photosynthesis. They also have a cell wall made of chitin, which is different from the cellulose found in plants. Additionally, both can reproduce sexually and asexually, and they have a life cycle that includes stages such as spore production, germination, and growth. However, mushrooms are fungi, not plants, and they lack chlorophyll, which is why they cannot perform photosynthesis.",

        "expert_reply": "Mushrooms do not communicate in the same way that animals do. They do not have nervous systems or complex sensory organs to transmit signals. However, they do communicate through chemical signals, known as pheromones, which are released into the environment. These signals can attract other mushrooms of the same species to a suitable location for reproduction. This form of communication is crucial for the survival and dispersal of fungal species.",
