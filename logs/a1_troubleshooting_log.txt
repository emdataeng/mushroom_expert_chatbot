The text mentions that the spindling is often a sign of a large fungus in the forest, and it can be found in various colors, including orange and brown. The page also discusses the symptoms and treatment of the Cortinarius rubellus, noting that it contains the toxin orellanin, which has a specific neurotoxic effect. The symptoms include intense tingling, numbness, and a feeling of being stuck in the neck. Treatment involves immediate dialysis and, in severe cases, liver transplantation. The page also mentions the key features of the Cortinarius rubellus, such as the cap being matte, the spore print being reddish-brown, and the stem having a smooth, brown surface with a ring.

The image is a scan of a mushroom book page in Swedish, discussing the Cortinarius rubellus, also known as Cortinarius speciosissimus. This species is known for its distinctive reddish-brown to brownish cap and orange-brown spore print. It is considered toxic and contains the mycotoxin orellamine, which can cause severe symptoms including intense thirst, dry mouth, and difficulty swallowing. Treatment involves immediate dialysis and, in severe cases, liver transplantation. The spore print is orange-brown, and the cap is matt, often with a reddish-brown to brownish color.
