    A picture of five deadly webcap mushrooms growing in the forest. They are orange
    colors with brown snake-like patterns on the stipe. They are absolutely deadly as

    A picture of three false chanterelle mushroom growing in the forest. They are yellow
    and have gills. They are considered inedible as they can cause stomach upset in some
    people. They are often mistaken for the edible chanterelle, but the chanterelles
    have ridges instead of gills, are firmer, and have a distinctive smell.

mushroom_parasol_topview.jpg
    A picture of a false parasol mushroom growing on grass. The picture is taken from
    above, so the stipe is not visible. The mushroom is white with brown scales on the
    cap. This mushroom is edible but has variants that can cause stomach upset, like
    the false parasol. The false parasol has a bare, white stipe, while the parasol
    features a distinct pattern on the stipe. This image cannot be classified accurately
    as the stipe is not visible.
